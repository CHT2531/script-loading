Open index.html in a browser
Have a look at the JavaScript files. The application has been structured using modules.

We are going to re-write this application so that is uses the webpack to bundle our modules

First we need to install webpack 

Open a nodejs command prompt and enter 

```
npm install webpack@v1.13 -g
```
